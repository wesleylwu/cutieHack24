Inspiration
We all have had times where we did not score the best on our exams. One big reason for this was our studying habits, which is what inspired us to make a quiz maker to better prepare students for their future exams.

What it does
Our program allows users to input their questions and answers to create flashcards for them to study to be better prepared for exams. The program also creates quizzes out of the flashcards to help users further their knowledge on the topic. The program also has a save/load feature to save the users progress.

How we built it
We built this program through VSCode using C++. We used vectors/constructor to store all the flashcards the user makes and loops/randomization to make the quizzes for the user. We also used a text file to store and save the users progress.

Challenges we ran into
We ran into quite a few challenges throughout the hackathon like GitHub issues as well as trying to debug errors within our code.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to create a useful program that is beneficial to students. It is also our first project that we have made in a hackathon which is really exciting.

What we learned
We learned about how important teamwork is when making a group project. Lack of communication can cause issues that will halt progression.

What's next for Quiz Maker
In the future, we hope to expand our Quiz Maker by adding new features (AI, grades, points, timer, etc.) and making it available throughout all platforms (mobile, web, etc.)
